This second release addresses a few problems:

- Renamed `re:start`, `re:stop` and `re:status` tasks to `re-start`, `re-stop` and `re-status` respectively
  for more key "uniqueness" (i.e. decreased likelyhood of key-name collisions)
- Added option for configuring mainClass independently for `re-start` task
- Fixed #3 (Not working if there are multiple main classes)
- Closed #5 (Add option to specify CLI args for the forked JVM)
- Improved documentation
