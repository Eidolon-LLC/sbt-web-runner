This is a maintenance release:

- Group-ID changed from 'cc.spray' to 'io.spray'
- Removed top-level 'cc' package for all classes. If you use sbt full configuration
  you have to change your imports to 'import spray.revolver.RevolverPlugin._'
- Fixed #9: re-status now reliably shows if the process is still running
