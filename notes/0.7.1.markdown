This release fixes [severe bug][#21] occurring with multi-module projects where sbt-revolver could easily lose
track of started processes.

Other changes:

  * [#24][]: Make colors configurable. Thanks to [@rogach][] for this
    contribution.
  * [#25][]: Colors are never assigned twice as long as there are colors in the pool.
