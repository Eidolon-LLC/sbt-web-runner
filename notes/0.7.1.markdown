This release fixes [severe bug][#21] occurring with multi-module projects where sbt-revolver could easily lose
track of started processes.

Other changes:

  * [#23][]: Customizable log tags to show in front of log messages (instead of project name).
  * [#24][]: Make colors configurable. Thanks to [@rogach][] for this contribution.
  * [#25][]: Colors are never assigned twice as long as there are colors in the pool.
